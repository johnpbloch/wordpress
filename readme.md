## First Things First

Welcome. WordPress is a very special project to me. Every developer and contributor adds something unique to the mix, and together we create something beautiful that I’m proud to be a part of. Thousands of hours have gone into WordPress, and we’re dedicated to making it better every day. Thank you for making it part of your world.

— Matt Mullenweg

## Installation: Famous 5-minute install

1.  Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.
2.  Open <span class="file">[wp-admin/install.php](wp-admin/install.php)</span> in your browser. It will take you through the process to set up a `wp-config.php` file with your database connection details.
    1.  If for some reason this doesn’t work, don’t worry. It doesn’t work on all web hosts. Open up `wp-config-sample.php` with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection details.
    2.  Save the file as `wp-config.php` and upload it.
    3.  Open <span class="file">[wp-admin/install.php](wp-admin/install.php)</span> in your browser.
3.  Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the tables needed for your blog. If there is an error, double check your `wp-config.php` file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the [support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/ "WordPress support") with as much data as you can gather.
4.  **If you did not enter a password, note the password given to you.** If you did not provide a username, it will be `admin`.
5.  The installer should then send you to the [login page](wp-login.php). Sign in with the username and password you chose during the installation. If a password was generated for you, you can then click on “Profile” to change the password.

## Updating

### Using the Automatic Updater

If you are updating from version 2.7 or higher, you can use the automatic updater:

1.  Open <span class="file">[wp-admin/update-core.php](wp-admin/update-core.php)</span> in your browser and follow the instructions.
2.  You wanted more, perhaps? That’s it!

### Updating Manually

1.  Before you update anything, make sure you have backup copies of any files you may have modified such as `index.php`.
2.  Delete your old WordPress files, saving ones you’ve modified.
3.  Upload the new files.
4.  Point your browser to <span class="file">[/wp-admin/upgrade.php](wp-admin/upgrade.php).</span>

## Final Notes

*   If you have any suggestions, ideas, or comments, or if you (gasp!) found a bug, join us in the [Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/).
*   WordPress has a robust plugin <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> that makes extending the code easy. If you are a developer interested in utilizing this, see the [plugin documentation in the Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API "WordPress plugin API"). You shouldn’t modify any of the core code.

WordPress has no multi-million dollar marketing campaign or celebrity sponsors, but we do have something even better—you. If you enjoy WordPress please consider telling a friend, setting it up for someone less knowledgable than yourself, or writing the author of a media article that overlooks us.
